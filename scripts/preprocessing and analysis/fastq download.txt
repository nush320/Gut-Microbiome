Downloading fastq files method:

download qiime env.

conda activate qiime2-amplicon-2024.5

cat SRR_Acc_List.txt | parallel fastq-dump -X 10000 --split-files {}

mkdir fastq

mv *.fastq fastq

ls | wc -l # to check the number of files ensuring correct number downloaded

#note: for McLoed data: seems the data was merged since length is 253 (2*153 but overlapped reads taken out)

# for some reason for study 15 I was missing some files so I had to download the rest one by one using the following command:

fastq-dump --split-files -X 10000 SRR2143837

# I separated the files by the following command:
# List all *_1.fastq files and get just the SRR numbers
ls *_1.fastq | sed 's/_1.fastq//' > downloaded.txt
